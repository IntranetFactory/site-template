Since 1944, the GI Bill has helped millions of Veterans pay for college so they can have successful civilian careers. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, available for Veterans with active-duty service after September 11, 2001, also offers a living allowance, money for books, and the option to transfer education benefits you don't use to your spouse or children.

You have several options from which to choose. [Veterans Service Organizations](http://www.va.gov/vso/) and the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) can help you pick the best program for you.
